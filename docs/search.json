It also supports cross-validated testing, but this feature has not been extensively tested.\nAs the package was developed primarily to support my own PhD work, there may be a number of personal quirks in the way methods are interpreted and implemented.\nGitHub"

    "text": "I am a Lecturer in Security and Protection Science at the Department of Linguistics and English Language, Lancaster University, where I am affiliated with the Phonetics Lab and the Forensic Linguistics, Cybersecurity and Technology Research Group (FACTOR). I am also a memeber of the Data Science Institute.\nMy research is primarily situated in the area of forensic speech science, with a particular focus on questions related to bilingualism and voice identity. I also have broad interests in sociophonetics and articulatory and acoustic phonetics, and am keen on bringing theoretical, practical and methodological insights from these areas to the field of forensic phonetics.\nPreviously, I was a postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Department of Speech, Hearing and Phonetic Sciences, University College London, where I investigated the role of phonological contrasts and speaker variability on coarticulation as a member of the DFG-AHRC funded project Speakers, Listeners, Langauges: Patterns of Variability and Contrast in Spoken Language Dynamics.\nOutside work, I spend most time solving crosswords, living in fictional worlds and struggling to follow baking recipes."
