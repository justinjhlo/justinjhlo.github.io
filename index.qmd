I am a postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Department of Speech, Hearing and Phonetic Sciences, University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/research/speech-hearing-and-phonetic-sciences), investigating the role of phonological contrasts and speaker variability on coarticulation within the DFG-AHRC funded project *Speakers, Listeners, Langauges: Patterns of Variability and Contrast in Spoken Language Dynamics*. In September 2023, I will be a Lecturer in Security and Protection Science at the [Department of Linguistics and English Language, Lancaster University](https://lancaster.ac.uk/linguistics/).

My research is primarily situated in the area of forensic speech science, with a particular focus on questions related to bilingualism and voice identity. I also have broad interests in sociophonetics and articulatory and acoustic phonetics, and am keen on bringing theoretical, practical and methodological insights from these areas to the field of forensic phonetics.

Outside work, I spend most time solving crosswords, living in fictional worlds and struggling to follow baking recipes.
