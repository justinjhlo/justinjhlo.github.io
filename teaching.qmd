## PhD supervision

I am interested in supervising students in the areas of forensic speech science and sociophonetics, and especially welcome proposals in these areas that address issues related to multilingualism and/or take an experimental approach. Within forensic speech science, I am interested in phonetics-centred proposals that concern voice and identity in production and/or perception.

You are welcome to reach out to me for informal enquiries, but you should consult the Lancaster website for [information and guidance on PhD applications and funding](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/linguistics/phd/){target="_blank"} in the first instance.

## Teaching

I teach undergraduate and postgraduate modules in the areas of phonetics, forensic speech science, sociolinguistics, and quantitative methods. I also supervise BA and MA/MSc dissertations in these areas. In 2024/25, I teach on the following modules:
